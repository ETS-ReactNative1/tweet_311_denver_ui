## Project Goals

  - Use an agile process to turn defined requirements into deployed and production ready software

- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow (see whole-team expectations)
- Gain more experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features in various environments
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

## Project Board 

The team at Tweet311Denver followed an agile workflow with two week long sprints. Our team used a gitHub projects board with issues that were tracked by every member of the team.

Tweet311Denver encouraged code review processes by following a pull request template. It was encouraged that pull requests contain sections for what was happening, how to test the changes, any linked issues, screenshots when appropriate, and any relevant notes.
